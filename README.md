An example of a Keynote '13 `Index` tree, unpacked from a document bundle.

- The document uses the default black template
- It has two slides:
   - Slide 1 is a simple Title format slide, with title line "My title" and secondary line "My author"
   - Slide 2 is a simple bullet slide with headline "Some heading", a single bullet "Some bullet", and presenter notes "These are presenter notes." (in the default note style, which uses Avenir regular/black as the font)
